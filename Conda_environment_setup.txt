If you are not familiar with python/conda these steps can be used as an example to 
set up a conda environment from scratch to use FLEXTH:



1. download and install miniconda (light version of conda)
   https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html



2. open the conda command prompt and run >>> : 

  >>> conda config --add channels conda-forge 
  >>> conda config --set channel_priority strict



3. from the conda command prompt install mamba (packet manager)

  >>> conda install mamba



4. install spider as integrated development environment (IDE)

  >>> mamba install spyder



5. create a suitable environment named "flexth_env" where to use FLEXTH

  >>> mamba create -n flexth_env python=3.12 numpy scipy rasterio astropy opencv gdal scikit-image matplotlib spyder-kernels==2.5 -c conda-forge



6. run spyder from the base environment

  >>> spyder


7. open the FLEXTH script and change the spyder kernel to the one corresponding to the new "flexth_env" environment:

  go to: tools>preferences>python interpreter;
  choose " use the following python interpreter " and select from the list the new environment "flexth_env"
  If "flexth_env" is not in the list, you can browse to the "python.exe" that you find in the folder where the new environment 
  was created (typically : " C:\Users\Tom\miniconda3\envs\flexth_env\python.exe")


8. done  !
